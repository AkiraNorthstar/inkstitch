    This function builds a specialized graph (as in graph theory) that will
    help us determine a stitching path.  The idea comes from this paper:

    http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772100000158

    The goal is to build a graph that we know must have an Eulerian Path.
    An Eulerian Path is a path from edge to edge in the graph that visits
    every edge exactly once and ends at the node it started at.  Algorithms
    exist to build such a path, and we'll use Hierholzer's algorithm.

    A graph must have an Eulerian Path if every node in the graph has an
    even number of edges touching it.  Our goal here is to build a graph
    that will have this property.

    Based on the paper linked above, we'll build the graph as follows:

        * nodes are the endpoints of the grating segments, where they meet
        with the outer outline of the region the outlines of the interior
        holes in the region.
        * edges are:
        * each section of the outer and inner outlines of the region,
            between nodes
        * double every other edge in the outer and inner hole outlines

    Doubling up on some of the edges seems as if it will just mean we have
    to stitch those spots twice.  This may be true, but it also ensures
    that every node has 4 edges touching it, ensuring that a valid stitch
    path must exist.
