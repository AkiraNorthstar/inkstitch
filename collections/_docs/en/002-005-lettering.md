The lettering tool generates multi-line text as satin columns and dynamically routes stitching, breaking up satins if necessary and adding running stitch.

![Lettering Extensions](/assets/images/docs/lettering.jpg)

## Usage

* Run `Extensions > Ink/Stitch  > Lettering`
* Enter your text (multi-line is possible)
* Click on `Apply and Quit`

**Info:** The lettering tool is still in a very basic version. This means:<br><br>
<span style="color: #c50505;">✗</span> The option "Stitch lines of text back and forth" has not yet any effect.<br>
<span style="color: #c50505;">✗</span> There is only one font available at this point.<br><br>
But nevertheless it is a great helper already now.
