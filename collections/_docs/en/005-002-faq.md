## Installing Ink/Stitch

### I have downloaded and unzipped the [latest release](https://github.com/inkstitch/inkstitch/releases/latest). Where do I put it?

In Inkscape open: edit > preferences > system and check the paths for extensions.

You should preferably install in **USER EXTENSIONS** since this will make it easier to update later, try **INKSCAPE EXTENSIONS** path if you are having trouble running Ink/Stitch.


### My Ink/Stitch dosen't run!

This is more prone to happen in Windows, since the python is packed into a executable there are reports of anti-virus-software using heuristics that mark the extension as a false positive. The solution in this cases is to add the Ink/Stitch extension folder to the exception list on the av program reinstall the extension and try again.

There are user reports [#118](https://github.com/inkstitch/inkstitch/issues/118) from windows users that the extension may have trouble with paths that have special characters.

## Using Ink/Stitch

### Guidelines Origin isn't working!

The guideline method for setting the origin (0,0) is deprecated. Use [visual commands](/docs/commands) instead.
