## What it is
Bean stitch describes a repetition of running stitches back and forth. This would result in thicker threading.

## How to Create
1. Select a **dashed stroke** and open `Extensions > Ink/Stitch > English > Params`.

2. Set the number of repeats to `Bean stitch number of repeats` when in [running stitch mode](/docs/stitches/running-stitch).

   ![Bean Stitch Params](/assets/images/docs/en/params-bean-stitch.jpg)

   * A value of 1 would triple each stitch (forward, back, forward).
   * A value of 2 would quintuple each stitch, etc.
