## Auto-Fill
AutoFill is the default method for generating fill stitching. To use it, create a **closed path with a fill color**. This algorithm works for complex shapes with or without holes.

**Info:** Ink/Stitch will break the shape up into sections that it can embroider at once using back-and-forth rows of stitches. It then adds straight-stitching between sections until it's filled in the entire design. The staggered pattern of stitches is continued seamlessly between sections, so the end result doesn't appear to have any breaks. When moving from one section to the next, it generates running stitching along the border of the shape.

### Set Start and End Point

Since Ink/Stitch v1.11.0 it is possible to set start and end points for autofill objects. You will need to install [Ink/Stitch visual commands](/docs/addons/) for this purpose.

### Params

![Params AutoFill](/assets/images/docs/en/params-autofill.jpg)

Settings|Description
---|---
Automatically routed fill stitching|Must be enabled for these settings to take effect.
Angle of lines of stitches|The angle of the rows of stitches, in degrees. 0 is horizontal, and the angle increases in a counter-clockwise direction. Negative angles are allowed.
Expand|Expand the shape before fill stitching, to compensate for gaps between shapes.
Maximum fill stitch length|The length of each stitch in a row. "Max" is because a shorter stitch may be used at the start or end of a row.
Spacing between rows|Distance between rows of stitches
Running stitch length|Length of stitches around the outline of the fill region used when moving from section to section
Stagger this many times before repeating|Stitches are staggered so that neighboring rows of stitches don't all fall in the same column (which would create a distracting valley effect). Setting this dictates how many rows apart the stitches will be before they fall in the same column position.

### Underlay
By default, AutoFill will cover the shape with one layer of stitches.  In almost all cases, this won't look any good.  The individual stitches will sink into the fabric (even if it's thin) and the fill will appear sparse.  The fabric may even stick up between rows.

To solve this, you need underlay: an initial layer of stitches that hold up the final stitches.  Underlay for fill stitch usually comprises of fill stitching 90 degrees offset from the final fill (called "top stitching"). The row spacing should be much wider than in the top stitching. The goal is to flatten out the fabric and give the top stitches "rails" to sit on.

In **Params**, you'll see an underlay tab next to the AutoFill tab. Enable it by checking the box.

Settings|Description
---|---
Underlay|Must be enabled for these settings to take effect.
Fill angle|Defaults to 90 degrees angle to the top layer. It's the best value for most cases. But sometimes you might want to change your underlay directions.
Inset|Inset to cover the underlay entirely by the top layer. Negative values are possible (usefull for "knockdown" stitches).
Max stitch length|Maximum stitch length. Stitches can be shortened at the start or the end of a row.
Row spacing|Underlay row spacing. Defaults to 3x the spacing of the top layer.

## Manual-Fill
Manual Fill is the old mode before automatic fill routing was implemented.  In some cases, AutoFill may not be an option, such as when the running stitches between sections are not acceptable for your design.  Usually, fill region edges are covered over by satin, but not always.

In manual fill, the extension will still break up the shape into sections, each of which can be embroidered in one go.  Then these sections will be fill-stitched one at a time, jumping directly between sections.

You'll almost certainly want to break your shape up into smaller shapes and connect them using [running stitches](/docs/stitches/stroke/#running-stitch-mode). It's a painstaking process, made more so because you'll need to do it twice: once for the underlay and again for the top stitching.

Angle of lines of stitches|The angle of the rows of stitches, in degrees. 0 is horizontal, and the angle increases in a counter-clockwise direction. Negative angles are allowed.
Flip fill|The flip option can help you with routing your stitch path.  When you enable flip, stitching goes from right-to-left instead of left-to-right. Using flip and rotating 180 additional degrees (by adding or subtracting 180 from **angle**), you can cause fill stitching for a given shape to start from any of the four possible corners.
Maximum fill stitch length|The length of each stitch in a row. "Max" is because a shorter stitch may be used at the start or end of a row.
Spacing between rows|Distance between rows of stitches.
