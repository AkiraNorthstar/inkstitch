00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,560
In this part we are going to install Ink/Stitch on your computer.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,680
Although the installation process is quiet similar on the various operating systems,

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,520
you might prefer watching the video corresponding to yours.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,760
You find the tutorials for Windows and Linux in the description below.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,440
This is the tutorial for MacOS users.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
Let's start with the requirements.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,600
nk/Stitch is an Inkscape plugin.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,560
Which means you definitely need to have Inkscape installed.

10
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:52,120
Any version is fine, but we recommend to have at least version 0.92.2 installed,

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:59,060
because it comes with new features that are essential to organize the stitching order of your design.

12
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,900
You can download Inkscape for free on their website at inkscape.org

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,220
Ink/Stitch uses a web-browser to create print-out information sheets for both, operator and customer.

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,040
You might also enjoy this feature, because it optionally displays a realistic preview of your design.

15
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,660
To be able to use this feature you will need a modern HTML5 capable browser,

16
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,100
which you will most likely have already installed since you are watching this tutorial.

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,560
All other dependencies are delivered by the Ink/Stitch plugin itself.

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,960
Which makes the installation fairly easy.

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,340
To get the latest Ink/Stitch release for your operating system visit inkstitch.org

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,280
Click on "Download Ink/Stitch" and save the archive with osx_64 in its filename.

21
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:13,680
In Inkscape go to 'Edit > Preferences > System' and check where your user extensions folder is located.

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,280
Decompress the Ink/Stitch archive directly into the extensions folder.

23
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,000
And that's it. You already did all the steps necessary in order to install Ink/Stitch.

24
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
Now let's check if Ink/Stitch is actually working.

25
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,800
Restart Inkscape.

26
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,440
You will find the extension under 'Extensions > Ink/Stitch'

27
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Draw a shape

28
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
and convert it to a path.

29
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,720
With the newly created path selected run "Params".

30
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:52,960
Beside of the params dialogue you will see a simulation which will update as you change the values.

31
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,400
We hope you enjoyed the tutorial and have Ink/Stitch up and running.

32
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
 

33
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,440
If you run into any trouble during the installation process, please report your problem back to us on GitHub (link in the description below).

34
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,640
So we can help you to get started creating embroidery designs.
