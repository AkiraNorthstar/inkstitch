00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,560
In this part we are going to install Ink/Stitch on your computer.

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,320
Although the installation process is quiet similar on the various operating systems,

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
you might prefer watching the video corresponding to yours.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,500
You find the tutorials for Windows and Linux in the description below.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,280
This is the tutorial for MacOS users.

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,020
Let's start with the requirements.

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,680
Ink/Stitch is an Inkscape plugin. Which means you definitely need to have Inkscape installed.

9
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:52,040
Any version is fine, but we recommend to have at least version 0.92.2 installed,

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:59,120
because it comes with new features that are essential to organize the stitching order of your design.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,520
You can download Inkscape for free on their website at inkscape.org

12
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,120
Ink/Stitch uses a web-browser to create print-out information sheets for both, operator and customer.

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:21,040
You might also enjoy this feature, because it optionally displays a realistic preview of your design.

14
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,680
To be able to use this feature you will need a modern HTML5 capable browser,

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,240
which you will most likely have already installed since you are watching this tutorial.

16
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,160
All other dependencies are delivered by the Ink/Stitch plugin itself.

17
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,080
Which makes the installation fairly easy.

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,440
To get the latest Ink/Stitch release for your operating system visit inkstitch.org

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,120
Click on "Download Ink/Stitch" and save the archive with win32 in its filename.

20
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:14,360
In Inkscape go to 'Edit > Preferences > System' and check where your user extensions folder is located.

21
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,120
Decompress the Ink/Stitch archive directly into the extensions folder.

22
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,440
And that's it. You already did all the steps necessary in order to install Ink/Stitch.

23
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,360
Now let's check if Ink/Stitch is actually working.

24
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,920
Restart Inkscape.

25
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,240
You will find the extension under 'Extensions > Ink/Stitch'

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Draw a shape

27
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,120
and convert it to a path.

28
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,440
With the newly created path selected run "Params".

29
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,720
Beside of the params dialogue you will see a simulation which will update as you change the values.

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,400
We hope you enjoyed the tutorial and have Ink/Stitch up and running.

31
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:38,800
If you run into any trouble during the installation process, please report your problem back to us on GitHub (link in the description below).

32
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,480
So we can help you to get started creating embroidery designs.
