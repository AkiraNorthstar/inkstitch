00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to the Ink/Stitch beginner tutorial series.

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,020
In this part we are going to install Ink/Stitch on your computer.

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,120
Although the installation process is quiet similar on the various operating systems,

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,660
you might prefer watching the video corresponding to yours.

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,340
You find the tutorials for Windows and MacOS in the description below. This is the tutorial for Linux users.

6
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,940
Let's start with the requirements.

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,940
Ink/Stitch is an Inkscape plugin. Which means you definitely need to have Inkscape installed.

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:52,200
Any version is fine, but we recommend to have at least version 0.92.2 installed,

9
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,940
because it comes with new features that are essential to organize the stitching order of your design.

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,160
You can download Inkscape for free on their website at https://inkscape.org

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,220
Ink/Stitch uses a web-browser to create print-out information sheets for both, operator and customer.

12
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:21,280
You might also enjoy this feature, because it optionally displays a realistic preview of your design.

13
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,680
To be able to use this feature you will need a modern HTML5 capable browser,

14
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,200
which you will most likely have already installed since you are watching this tutorial.

15
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,340
All other dependencies are delivered by the Ink/Stitch plugin itself.

16
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,120
Which makes the installation fairly easy.

17
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,020
To get the latest Ink/Stitch release for your operating system visit https://inkstitch.org

18
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,700
Click on "Download Ink/Stitch" and save the archive with linux_64 in its filename.

19
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,700
In Inkscape go to 'Edit > Preferences > System' and check where your user extensions folder is located.

20
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Decompress the Ink/Stitch archive directly into the extensions folder.

21
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,360
And that's it. You already did all the steps necessary in order to install Ink/Stitch.

22
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,640
Now let's check if Ink/Stitch is actually working.

23
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Restart Inkscape.

24
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,360
You will find the extension under 'Extensions > Ink/Stitch'

25
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,880
Draw a shape

26
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,200
and convert it to a path.

27
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,240
With the newly created path selected run "Params".

28
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,560
Beside of the params dialogue you will see a simulation which will update as you change the values.

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,320
We hope you enjoyed the tutorial and have Ink/Stitch up and running.

30
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:33,040
If you run into any trouble during the installation process, please report your problem back to us on GitHub (link in the description below).

31
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,240
So we can help you to get started creating embroidery designs.
