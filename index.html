<p class="notice">Want to design embroidery pattern files (PES, DST, etc) using free, open source software?  Hate all the other options?  Try this one.</p>

<!-- {% include feature_row %} -->

<p>I received a really wonderful christmas gift for a geeky programmer hacker: an <a href="http://www.brother-usa.com/homesewing/ModelDetail.aspx?ProductID=SE400">embroidery machine</a>. It's pretty much a CNC thread-bot... I just had to figure out how to design programs for it.  The problem is, **all free embroidery design software seemed to be terrible**, especially when you add in the requirement of being able to run in Linux, my OS of choice.</p>

<p>So I wrote one.</p>

<p>Okay, not really.  I'm pretty terrible at GUIs, but I found this nifty inkscape extension that was created and hacked on by a couple of other folks.  It was pretty rudimentary, but it got the job done, and more importantly, it was super hackable.  I hacked the hell out of it, and at this point <strong>ink/stitch is a viable entry-level machine embroidery design tool</strong>.</p>
