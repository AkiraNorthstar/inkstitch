This is a little tool to help you to plan your stitch path precisely.

**How does it work**

* Select one or more satin column(s)
* Run `Extensions > Embroidery > Flip Satin Columns`


**What does it do**

If you have a satin column that starts on the left rail and ends on the right, this will make it start on the right rail and end on the left.
Nothing else about the satin is changed.

**Usage Example**

Flip satin columns to shorten connections between two different sections.
