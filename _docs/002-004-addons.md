Ink/Stitch can install files ("add-ons") that make it easier to use Inkscape to create machine embroidery designs.

**Add-ons to be installed**
* [thread manufacturer color palettes](/docs/addons/#thread-manufacturer-color-palettes)
* [Ink/Stitch visual commands (Objects -> Symbols ...)](/docs/addons/#visual-commands)

**Install**
* Go to `Extensions > Embroidery > Install add-ons for Inkscape`
* Click `Install`
* Restart Inkscape

**Manual Install**
* *Palettes*: Copy extension files from `inkstitch > palettes` folder to your Inkscape palettes folder. E.g. in Linux: `~/.config/inkscape/palettes`.
* *Visual Commands*:Copy extension files from `inkstitch > symbols` folder to your Inkscape symbols folder. E.g. in Linux: `~/.config/inkscape/symbols`.

## Thread Manufacturer Color Palettes

Inkscape palettes are found on the bottom to the right of the color swatches.

Click on the little arrow to open a list of installed palettes and choose the manufacturer color palette depending on the thread you are willing to use.

The choice will also take effect on the thread names to appear in the print preview.

## Visual commands

The symbols dialog (`Object > Symbols` or `Shift+Ctrl+Y` > `Ink/Stitch Commands`) contains 4 icons. They indicate the following functions:

![starting point symbol](/assets/images/docs/visual-commands-start.jpg)Fill stitch starting point
![ending point symbol](/assets/images/docs/visual-commands-end.jpg) Fill stitch ending point
![trim symbol](/assets/images/docs/visual-commands-trim.jpg) Trim the thread after sewing this object
![stop symbol](/assets/images/docs/visual-commands-stop.jpg)Stop the machine after sewing this object (for applique, etc)

**Info:**
Starting and ending point currently apply only to fill-stitch objects, while trim and stop commands take effect on any connected object.
{: .notice--info }

### Attach visual commands via extension

* Select one ore more objects
* Run `Extensions > Embroidery > Attach Command...`
* Enable desired commands and apply
* Auto-Fill: Move starting and ending points. The connector's endpoint nearest to the fill object is the point at which stitching will start or end.

### Attach visual commands manually
* Go to `Object > Symbols` or hit `Shift+Ctrl+Y` to access the markers through the symbols dialog.
* Select "Ink/Stitch Commands" as the symbol set.

* Drag a marker out onto your canvas (doesn't matter where).
* Use the Flow-Chart Tool ("create diagram connectors" `Ctrl+F2`) to draw a connection between the marker and the fill object to which it should apply. This will add a connector path.
* Moving the marker will change the connector's position to match. You can also move the endpoints of the connector manually. The connector's endpoint nearest to the fill object is the point at which stitching will start or end.

### Visual commands reference
#### Stop
Commercial embroidery machines that have multiple needles normally proceed from one color to the next without pausing in between. Sometimes you *want* a pause (e.g. to trim applique fabric), so "STOP after" adds an extra color change which can be assigned to a special stop instruction using the machine's user interface (e.g. C00 on Barudan machines). Common uses for this would be to apply puff foam after doing regular embroidery.  Applying applique fabric and/or even wanting to slow down the machine at a certain spot for certain types of embroidery without having to babysit the machine.

#### Trim
"Trim after" tells the embroidery machine to cut the thread after the assigned object has been stitched.  Not all home machines support the trim function within a color block.  Mainly used to prevent long jump stitched between embroidery objects and to avoid post embroidery trimming by the operator.
