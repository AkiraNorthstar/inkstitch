Ink/Stitch can install files ("add-ons") that make it easier to use Inkscape to create machine embroidery designs.

**Add-ons to be installed**
* [thread manufacturer color palettes](/docs/addons/#thread-manufacturer-color-palettes)
* [Ink/Stitch visual commands (Objects -> Symbols ...)](/docs/addons/#visual-commands)

**Install**
* Go to `Extensions > Embroidery > Install add-ons for Inkscape`
* Click `Install`
* Restart Inkscape

**Manual Install**
* *Palettes*: Copy extension files from `inkstitch > palettes` folder to your Inkscape palettes folder. E.g. in Linux: `~/.config/inkscape/palettes`.
* *Visual Commands*:Copy extension files from `inkstitch > symbols` folder to your Inkscape symbols folder. E.g. in Linux: `~/.config/inkscape/symbols`.

## Thread Manufacturer Color Palettes

Inkscape palettes are found on the bottom to the right of the color swatches.

Click on the little arrow to open a list of installed palettes and choose the manufacturer color palette depending on the thread you are willing to use.

The choice will also take effect on the thread names to appear in the print preview.

## Visual commands

This method currently applies only to fill-stitch objects.

* Go to `Object > Symbols` or hit `Shift+Ctrl+Y` to access the markers through the symbols dialog.
* Select "Ink/Stitch Commands" as the symbol set.

* Drag a marker out onto your canvas (doesn't matter where).
* Use the Flow-Chart Tool ("create diagram connectors" `Ctrl+F2`) to draw a connection between the marker and the fill object to which it should apply. This will add a connector path.
* Moving the marker will change the connector's position to match. You can also move the endpoints of the connector manually. The connector's endpoint nearest to the fill object is the point at which stitching will start or end.
