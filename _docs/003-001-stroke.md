**Info:** If an object consists of multiple paths, they will be stitched in order with a jump between each.

## Running Stitch Mode

Running stitch can be created by setting a **dashed stroke** on a path. Any type of dashes will do the job, and the stroke width is irrelevant.

Go to `Object > Fill and Stroke...` or hit `Shift+Ctrl+F` and choose one of the dashed lines in the `Stroke style` tab.

**Info:** In order to avoid rounding corners, an extra stitch will be added at the point of any sharp corners.

## Manual Stitch Mode

Enable `Manual stitch placement` to make use of the manual stitch mode. Line style or width are irrelevant. In manual stitch mode Ink/Stitch will use each node of a path as a needle penetration point, exactly as you placed them. Note: It will not add tie-in or tie-off stitches automatically, so be aware of creating them within the path.

{% include tutorial_list key="stitch-type" value="Manual Stitch" %}

## Zig-Zag Stitch Mode (previously Simple Satin)
Zig-Zag stitches can be created by setting a **continuous line** (without dashes). Ink/Stitch will create stitches along the path using the stroke width you specified.

Go to `Object > Fill and Stroke...` or hit `Shift+Ctrl+F` and set the desired stroke width in the `Stroke style` tab.

**Info:** It is not recommended to use the Zig-Zag Stitch Mode to create a satin border, use [Satin Column](/docs/stitches/satin/) instead.<br /><br />
Ink/Stitch will plot zig-zags to the left and right of the line from start to end, but it won’t do anything special around curves and corners. Sharper curves and corners will result in sparse stitching around the outside of the curve and dense stitching around the inside. This won’t look good and may even poke holes in the insides of corners.<br /><br />
{: .notice--warning }

**Info:** You may discover that the stroke width fails if the viewbox has different scaling for X and Y - or the object or any of its parent groups has a `transform` attribute set (which can easliy happen if you resize a group in Inkscape).<br /><br />
Use [Satin Column](/docs/stitches/satin/) instead.
