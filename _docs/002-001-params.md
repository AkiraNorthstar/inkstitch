## Basic Usage
-> For detailed explanation on stitches see: Stitch Library
## Stop after
"Stop after" allows commercial embroidery machine users the ability to stop the machine during the stitch out at a pre-defined location.  Common uses for this would be to apply puff foam after doing regular embroidery.  Applying applique fabric and/or even wanting to slow down the machine at a certain spot for certain types of embroidery without having to babysit the machine.
## Trim after
"Trim after" tells the embroidery machine to cut the thread after the assigned object has been stitched.  Not all home machines support the trim function within a color block.  Mainly used to prevent long jump stitched between embroidery objects and to avoid post embroidery trimming by the operator.
